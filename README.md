    Game Premise   
Player will use mouse clicking to navigate thier way through obsticals.
Their score will be measured by the amount of time they can go without hitting an obstical.
If a player hits and obstical (celing, floor, any of the movint targets) the game will end and timer will stop. 
Player will be prompted to "Play Again?" at which point the game will restart

   
    User Story
As a player I want to be able to click the mouse and have the helicopter move up and down to avoid passing obsticals. When I click the mouse I want the helicopter to move upward, and when I release the mouse I want the helicopter to move downward.  If I continue to avoid objects, I want the game speed to increase and have more obsticals appear. I would like the soreboard to keep track of the amount of time I was able to go without hitting an obstcal. If I hit an obstical (floor, celing, moving obsticle) I will die and the timer will stop and hold my latest time. I would like the option to restart the game after dying.
